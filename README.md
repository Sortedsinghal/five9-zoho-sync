# Five9 → Zoho CRM → Zoho Campaigns Sync & Email Automation

A fully automated, end-to-end lead pipeline that takes inbound callers from **Five9** (cloud contact center) all the way through to a **personalized outbound email** — without any manual intervention.

The service polls Five9 every 2 minutes via SOAP API, pushes new leads into **Zoho CRM**, which syncs them into a **Zoho Campaigns** contact list, triggering a language-aware automation workflow that sends the right email template — **English or Spanish** — based on the caller's detected language.

## Full Pipeline Overview

Every inbound call handled by Five9 that has a valid email address goes through this automated sequence with zero manual steps:

```
Inbound Call (Five9)
       │
       ▼
  Call ends → call logged in Five9 report
       │
       ▼  (every 2 minutes)
  Node.js Sync Service polls Five9 SOAP API
       │
       ├── No email? → Skip
       ├── Already in Zoho CRM? → Skip (dedup)
       │
       ▼
  New lead created in Zoho CRM
  (First Name, Last Name, Email, Mobile, Language)
       │
       ▼  (Zoho CRM → Campaigns sync)
  Lead added to "Five9 List" in Zoho Campaigns
       │
       ▼  (Automation triggers on list entry)
  Language condition evaluated
       │
       ├── Language = Spanish → Send Spanish email template
       └── Language = English → Send English email template
```

The entire journey — from call ending in Five9 to the lead receiving a personalized email — happens within minutes, fully automated.

```

## How It Works

### 1. Automated Polling Loop (`server.js`)

On startup, the service reads `sync-state.json` to find the last time it successfully synced. It then runs a polling loop every **2 minutes**:

```
loadSyncState()           ← read lastSyncTime from sync-state.json
setInterval(2 min)
  └─▶ fetchFive9Report()
        ├─▶ Connect to Five9 via SOAP (AdminWebService.wsdl)
        ├─▶ Run report for the time window [lastSyncTime → now]
        ├─▶ Wait for report to finish generating
        ├─▶ Download CSV result
        ├─▶ Parse each row (email, name, phone, language)
        └─▶ For each valid row:
              ├─▶ Check if lead already exists in Zoho (by email)
              └─▶ If new → create lead in Zoho CRM
                         └─▶ Zoho CRM syncs to Campaigns list
                                  └─▶ Automation fires → email sent
  └─▶ saveSyncState()     ← update lastSyncTime checkpoint
```

### 2. Zoho Campaigns Automation ("Day 0 - Outbound Campaign")

Once a lead lands in Zoho CRM, it is automatically synced to the **"Five9 List"** contact list in Zoho Campaigns. This triggers the **Day 0 - Outbound Campaign** automation workflow, which:

1. **Trigger:** Contact added to Five9 List
2. **Condition check:** Evaluates the `Language` field
   - `True` → contact speaks **Spanish** → sends the **Spanish email template**
   - `False` → contact speaks **English** → sends the **English email template**

This ensures every lead receives a follow-up email in their own language, immediately after their call — with no human in the loop.

### 3. Webhook Endpoint (`POST /lead`)

An Express HTTP endpoint that lets external systems (e.g. Zoho Flow, Zapier) push a lead directly into Zoho CRM on demand — bypassing the Five9 report flow entirely. The lead still flows into Zoho Campaigns and triggers the same email automation.

### 4. Bulk CSV Import (`process.js`)

A standalone one-time script to bulk-import historical call data from a local `input.csv` file into Zoho CRM. Used for backfilling records; not part of the main service.

## Pipeline Stats & Efficiency

These numbers reflect the live production run of the automation:

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Leads entered Zoho Campaigns workflow** | **178** | Contacts added to Five9 List and processed by the automation |
| **Exited Workflow** | **3** | Contacts who completed the full automation path |
| **Automation name** | Day 0 - Outbound Campaign | Active since Jul 02, 2026 |
| **Trigger** | On List Entry — Five9 List | Fires the moment a new contact is added |
| **Language routing branches** | 2 | English template (False) / Spanish template (True) |
| **Polling interval** | Every 2 minutes | Minimum delay from call end to CRM entry |
| **Dedup rate** | Prevents 100% of re-sends | Email-based check before every Zoho write |
| **Token auto-refresh** | Every 50 minutes | Keeps auth alive with no downtime |
| **SOAP retry coverage** | Up to 3 attempts | Handles Five9 transient failures automatically |
| **Rows skipped (no email / invalid)** | Variable per run | Rows with empty, `-`, or non-`@` emails are filtered out |

### Why this is efficient

- **No polling gaps:** The 2-minute interval with persistent checkpointing means calls are picked up nearly in real time, and the service never re-processes the same window twice.
- **Zero duplicate leads:** Every lead is checked against Zoho CRM by email before creation. The dedup logic runs at the application layer, not just relying on Zoho's built-in duplicate rules.
- **Zero missed emails:** Because the Zoho Campaigns automation is triggered by list entry (not a scheduled batch), every new lead gets their email the moment they're synced — no waiting for a nightly job.
- **Language accuracy:** The `Language` field is normalized at the point of sync (Five9 CSV → `"English"` or `"Spanish"`), so the Campaigns condition always receives a clean, consistent value.
- **Fault tolerance:** Five9 SOAP calls retry 3 times on failure. The OAuth token refreshes proactively before expiry. If the service crashes, it resumes from the last saved checkpoint — no records are skipped.

├── server.js            # Main service — polling loop + Express webhook
├── process.js           # One-shot bulk CSV import script
├── sync-state.json      # Persistent checkpoint (last synced timestamp)
├── AdminWebService.wsdl # Five9 SOAP WSDL (excluded from repo — see note below)

## Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your credentials:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `REFRESH_TOKEN` | Zoho OAuth 2.0 refresh token |
| `CLIENT_ID` | Zoho API client ID |
| `CLIENT_SECRET` | Zoho API client secret |
| `API_DOMAIN` | Zoho API base URL (e.g. `https://www.zohoapis.com`) |
| `LANGUAGE_FIELD` | Zoho CRM API name for the Language field (e.g. `Language`) |
| `FIVE9_USERNAME` | Five9 admin/API username |
| `FIVE9_PASSWORD` | Five9 account password |
| `FIVE9_REPORT_NAME` | Exact name of the report in Five9 (case-sensitive) |
| `FIVE9_FOLDER_NAME` | Five9 folder containing the report (e.g. `Shared Reports`) |
| `PORT` | HTTP server port — defaults to `8080` |

### Getting Zoho OAuth Credentials

1. Go to [Zoho API Console](https://api-console.zoho.com/) and create a **Server-based Application**
2. Add the scope: `ZohoCRM.modules.leads.ALL`
3. Use **Self Client** to generate a grant code, then exchange it for a refresh token:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://accounts.zoho.com/oauth/v2/token" \
  -d "code=YOUR_GRANT_CODE" \
  -d "client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID" \
  -d "client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET" \
  -d "redirect_uri=https://www.zohoapis.com" \
  -d "grant_type=authorization_code"
```

The `refresh_token` from the response goes into `.env`.

---

## Local Development

**Prerequisites:** Node.js v18+, `AdminWebService.wsdl` in the project root.

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the service
npm start
```

On startup you'll see:

```
✅ Loaded checkpoint: 2026-06-10T20:41:00.000Z
🚀 API running on port 8080
🔄 Fetching Five9...
⏱️ Fetch Window:
START: 2026-06-10T20:41:00.000Z
END:   2026-06-10T20:43:00.000Z
```

### Bulk Backfill

To import historical data from a CSV export:

```bash
# Place your exported CSV as input.csv in the project root
node process.js
```

Required CSV columns: `email`, `CUSTOMER NAME`, `Language`.

---

## Deployment (AWS EC2)

The service runs as a persistent Node.js process on an EC2 instance. The recommended setup is:

- **Instance:** `t3.micro` (free tier eligible, sufficient for this workload)
- **OS:** Amazon Linux 2023 or Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- **Runtime:** Node.js 20 via `nvm`
- **Process manager:** PM2 — keeps the service alive across SSH disconnects and reboots
- **Port:** The service listens on `0.0.0.0:8080`; optionally front it with Nginx on port 80

### Key deployment steps (high level):

1. Launch EC2 instance with port `8080` open in the security group
2. SSH in, install Node.js and git, clone this repo
3. Upload `AdminWebService.wsdl` and `.env` to the server (these are not in the repo)
4. Run `npm install` and start with PM2: `pm2 start server.js --name five9-zoho-sync`
5. Run `pm2 save` + `pm2 startup` so the service restarts on reboot

### Updating

```bash
cd ~/five9-zoho-sync
git pull origin main
pm2 restart five9-zoho-sync
```

> `sync-state.json` is written locally to disk — it persists between restarts and `git pull` updates on EC2. No checkpoint data is lost during normal deployments.

---

## API Endpoints

### `POST /lead`

Push a single lead directly into Zoho CRM.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "email": "caller@example.com",
  "name": "Alex Rivera",
  "language": "Spanish"
}
```

**Success Response:**
```json
{ "success": true }
```

**Error Response (missing email):**
```json
{ "error": "Email required" }
```

**Example:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://YOUR_SERVER:8080/lead \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"caller@example.com","name":"Alex Rivera","language":"Spanish"}'
```

---

## Sync State & Checkpointing

The service tracks its position in time using `sync-state.json`:

```json
{
  "lastSyncTime": "2026-06-10T20:41:00.000Z"
}
```

- **On startup** — reads this file and resumes from the stored timestamp
- **After each poll** — updates the timestamp to the end of the fetched window
- **If file is missing** — defaults to syncing the last 5 minutes and creates the file

### Manual Reset

To force a re-sync from a specific point in time:

```bash
echo '{"lastSyncTime":"2026-07-01T00:00:00.000Z"}' > sync-state.json
pm2 restart five9-zoho-sync
```

## Integration Details

### Five9 SOAP API

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Protocol | SOAP via `soap` npm package |
| Auth | HTTP Basic Auth (username + password) |
| WSDL | Local file: `AdminWebService.wsdl` |
| Endpoint | `https://api.five9.com/wsadmin/v2/AdminWebService` |

**Report execution flow:**

| Step | SOAP Method | What it does |
|------|------------|--------------|
| 1 | `runReportAsync` | Submits the report for a given time window; returns a report `identifier` |
| 2 | `isReportRunningAsync` | Polls until Five9 finishes generating the report |
| 3 | `getReportResultCsvAsync` | Downloads the final CSV output |

**CSV fields extracted:**

| CSV Column | Maps to Zoho Field |
|------------|-------------------|
| `email` | `Email` |
| `first_name` | `First_Name` |
| `last_name` | `Last_Name` |
| `number1` | `Mobile` |
| `Language` | Custom language field |

Rows without a valid email (empty, `-`, or no `@`) are automatically skipped.
`runReport` retries up to **3 times** with 5-second delays on network failure.

---

### Zoho CRM OAuth 2.0

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Flow | Refresh Token (no user interaction at runtime) |
| Token URL | `https://accounts.zoho.com/oauth/v2/token` |
| Token lifetime | 1 hour |
| Auto-refresh | Triggered when token age > 50 minutes |

**Duplicate prevention:** Before creating any lead, the service calls `GET /crm/v2/Leads/search?email=...`. If a record already exists, the lead is skipped.

**Zoho fields written on lead creation:**

| Zoho API Field | Source |
|---------------|--------|
| `First_Name` | Five9 `first_name` |
| `Last_Name` | Five9 `last_name` |
| `Customer_Name` | Concatenated full name |
| `Email` | Five9 `email` |
| `Mobile` | Five9 `number1` |
| `Language` | Normalized to `"English"` or `"Spanish"` |

`trigger: ["workflow"]` is included on every lead creation call so Zoho automation rules fire normally.

---

### Zoho Campaigns Automation

The Zoho Campaigns side of the pipeline is a workflow called **"Day 0 - Outbound Campaign"**, active since July 2, 2026.

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Trigger | On List Entry — **Five9 List** |
| Condition | Simple Condition on `Language` field |
| Branch: True | Send **Spanish Template** email |
| Branch: False | Send **English Template** email |

**How the condition works:**

The automation evaluates the `Language` field of the newly added contact:
- If the condition is **True** (language is Spanish) → the contact receives the **Spanish email template**
- If the condition is **False** (any other value, defaults to English) → the contact receives the **English email template**

This branching is possible because the sync service normalizes the language field to exactly `"English"` or `"Spanish"` before writing to Zoho CRM, giving the Campaigns condition a clean, consistent value to evaluate — no ambiguous strings, no missing values.

**Workflow nodes (as configured):**

```
[ON LIST ENTRY — Five9 List]
         │
         ▼
 [Simple Condition]
    ┌────┴─────┐
  False       True
    │           │
    ▼           ▼
[MESSAGE:   [MESSAGE:
 English     Spanish
 Template]   Template]
```

## Troubleshooting

**Token refresh fails on startup**
- Double-check `REFRESH_TOKEN`, `CLIENT_ID`, and `CLIENT_SECRET` in `.env`
- Confirm the Zoho OAuth app has the `ZohoCRM.modules.leads.ALL` scope
- Refresh tokens expire after ~60 days of inactivity — regenerate one via the API Console

**`No report identifier returned` from Five9**
- `FIVE9_REPORT_NAME` must match the report name in Five9 exactly (case-sensitive, spaces included)
- Verify `FIVE9_FOLDER_NAME` is correct
- Ensure the Five9 API user account has permission to run that report

**SOAP / WSDL connection errors**
- Confirm `AdminWebService.wsdl` exists in the project root directory
- Verify Five9 credentials are correct and the account is not locked or expired

**Leads appearing as duplicates in Zoho**
- The dedup check is keyed on `email` — ensure Five9 report rows contain clean, valid email addresses
- Check that Zoho's own duplicate-blocking rules aren't suppressing the API's built-in check

**Viewing live logs on EC2**

```bash
pm2 logs five9-zoho-sync              # live tail
pm2 logs five9-zoho-sync --lines 200  # last 200 lines
